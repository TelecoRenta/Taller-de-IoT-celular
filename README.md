# Taller-de-IoT-celular


Workshop title: ***TALLER DE COMUNICACIÓN Y OPTIMIZACIÓN ENERGÉTICA
CON DISPOSITIVOS IOT CELULAR (NB-IOT, LTE-M)***

The goal of the workshop is to introduce the assistants to the cellular IoT low-power technologies (NB-IoT, LTE-M), which will be part of the technologies for future 5G massive IoT communications.

The workshop is supported by two types of files: 
1. **PDF guides** that consist in one guide for the instructor and another guide for the student following this workshop 
2. The file `example_workshopCIoT.otii` which contains a set of ordered recordings from an Otii Consumption Analyser and must be opened with the [Otii 2 Software - Release 2.8.4](https://www.qoitech.com/download). These recordings can be used as a reference for the exercises proposed to the students

In addition to the above files it will be necessary to use hardware components, some mandatory and others that are optional. None of these hardware components are provided as part of the workshop and should be acquired by the organizers of the workshop.
